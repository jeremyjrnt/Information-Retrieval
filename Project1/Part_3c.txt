The most common terms ("the", "of", "in", "a", "and, ...) are English "stop words" that appear in nearly every document and do not carry semantic context. The rarest terms are numeric strings that appear in only a single document each. They likely come from a specific numeric format in a document rather than meaningful content. We can say that both most common and rarest terms do not convey semantic information.
